This project is a Departmental or Institutional Inventory Management System that I (Bernard Andoh) developed alongside Jacques Appiagyei. The system is designed to simplify inventory management for organizations, especially educational institutions. It manages supplies, equipment, or products for various departments, such as MCA, MBA, and BTech. Key features include the ability to add and manage product categories and brands, submit and handle product requests, and manage product allotment to faculty members or departments. The goal is to create a streamlined, user-friendly platform for tracking inventory and improving transparency across departments.
